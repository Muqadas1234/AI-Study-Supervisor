## Overview

This project leverages NLP and large language models to build an intelligent study assistant. Upload any PDF document, and ask questions that the AI answers by referencing your material.

---

## Features

- Upload PDF files with study content.
- Extracts and chunks text for efficient semantic search.
- Uses SentenceTransformers + FAISS for semantic retrieval.
- Generates answers with Groq‚Äôs LLaMA3 large language model.
- User-friendly Gradio interface.

## Installation

!pip install -q gradio sentence-transformers faiss-cpu pdfplumber groq

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The AI Study Supervisor processes your uploaded PDF and intelligently answers questions based on its content. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

üîç 1. Text Extraction from PDF
The user uploads a study material PDF.

The app uses pdfplumber to extract raw text from all pages.

Extracted text is combined into a single string for processing.

‚úÇÔ∏è 2. Text Chunking
The full text is split into smaller, manageable chunks (default: 500 characters each).

Chunking improves search performance and ensures the embedding model handles inputs within its size limits.

üß† 3. Embedding & Indexing
Each chunk is transformed into a vector embedding using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from SentenceTransformers.

These embeddings are added to a FAISS index for fast semantic search.

The index is stored in memory for real-time querying.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection (to download models and access Groq API)
- Groq API key (register at [https://groq.com](https://groq.com))
